This file should not be copied to the image by Docker

Specific setup notes:
* Need /etc/cjdns in a volume
* IP is ipv6 in /etc/cjdns/cjdroute.conf
* Will need to manually add peers to interfaces.UDPInterface[].connectTo in cjdroute.conf
  * Note that adding multiple peers might mean hyperboria traffic gets routed through you
  * Should be relatively low traffic anyway
* Need to `docker run --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --device=/dev/net/tun`
