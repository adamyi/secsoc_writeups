## Solution

As the name suggests, there are bits and pieces in the _shop.zip_ archive, in the form of ingredients.  
The goal is to construct a pizza using these ingredients so you might want to figure out a way to combine these files together.    
Upon inspection the files each contain one or more non-null bytes, and as the name suggests, you should try bit manipulation on the files. 

Just by bit-wise adding or xoring the files together, you will get the flag :D
(the solution script demonstrates how to do this)
