# Pluses and Minuses
Challenge is in challenge.txt

## Description
I only write in pluses and minuses. Oh, and dots too.

## How to solve
This is a simple substitution cipher with Brainfuck-style syntax.

Initialise an int variable and set it to 0. Increment it everytime you see a '+' and decrement it everytime you see a '-'.
When you see a '.', convert that variable into its ASCII character equivalent. Repeat this until you've traversed the
whole string.

A frainbuck.c program has been provided to encrpyt any string input. A defrainbuck.py program has been provided to decrypt it.

## Hint
Start from zero.
