## Walkthrough
If you didn't regconise the tweaked ritual from the "The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual", Googling would gave you that clue.

From there, you will find that this story is from 1 out of 12 stories of "The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes",
after that all you need to do is to look up corresponding words using the clues in my ritual.

**The sixth from the first** - sixth word from the first story - "The Adventure of the Silver Blaze"

**Reigate by 2 and by 15** - 2nd and 15th word from "The Adventure of the Reigate Squire"

**Gloria by 21 and by 4** - 21st and 4th word from "The Adventure of the Gloria Scott"

**Musgrave by 10 and by 13** - 10th and 13th word from "The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual"

**Naval by 27 and by 13** - 27th and 13th of the Naval Treaty

When you piece all the words you got, you should get the flag!
