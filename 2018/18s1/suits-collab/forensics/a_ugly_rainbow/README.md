# A Ugly Rainbow
```  
Series of dots in a svg file, scrape out the colors, reads the hex codes as text and hidden in the text dump is the flag
```  
## Flavourtext
I made a beautiful image with all these colorful dots, please admire it and tease out the hidden meaning

## Hint
Wow those colors sure do look dull, I wonder why the artist picked them in such a small range  

## Walkthrough
Just look at the image and notice the colors are weird and chosen arbitarily.   
scrapre the raw svg for all the hex codes, put them end to end to generate a text dump and in the text dump will be a beautiful flag.  

## Flag
FLAG{i_3ncrypt_w1th_h3x_vry_s3cvre}
