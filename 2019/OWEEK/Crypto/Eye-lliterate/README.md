# Title
Eye-lliterate


## Flavour (for players to see)
The eyes are the windows to the soul, but not to the flag - ping @Viv in K17 Slack for troubleshooting/hints


## Running (how to run, if required)
Just give them the cipher text - cipher.txt :)


## Walkthrough
* Downlaod and open cipher.txt, you'll see 1's and 0's which you might think is binary
* Upon closer look (with the help of title and flavour text), you might realise that it's actually Braille Code 
* Each Braille character is read with 3 vertically down and 2 across.
e.g.
```
11
01
00
```
* Search on the internet for the corresponding Braille -> alphanumerals
* Once decoded, you should end up with this string: 4f 57 45 45 4b 7b 74 68 33 5f 33 79 33 7d 
* Which is in Hex, put this into any online coverter will give you the flag :)
