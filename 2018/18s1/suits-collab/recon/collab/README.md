# Collab

## Flavortext 
We've split the flag into half and hidden it on our websites, can you find both pieces ?  

https://unswsecurity.com/  
https://suits.org.au/  

(Final flag should be the combination of both flags, but you already knew that didn't you?)

## Hint
SUITS:  it's a .txt file, prepare your wordlists.   
SecSoc: Use the source, Luke 


## Solution
- For `https://unswsecurity.com/`:   
  - Simply view the source and check out all the links, one of them goes to a [.css](https://unswsecurity.com/static/css/index.css) file with the flag !    
  
- For `https://suits.org.au/`:  _(Note that it's been taken down already)_   
  - You had to go to `/robots.txt` and scroll down to find another hint which was `/memes.txt`
  - Navigating to `/memes.txt` gets you the flag 


## Answer
FLAG{its_collabor18_and_friendship_is_the_new_hot_meme}


## Bonus
Some players managed to find the red herring that we planted in   
`unswsecurity.com/lol.xml` , well done, and sorry if you got confused !
