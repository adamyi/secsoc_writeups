Long long time ago, in an alternate universe far far away, Coruscant is not a prosperous
republic built on the Order of Jedi, but a post-apocalyptic wasteland
where the only entertainment is Chewbacca Mask Lady and bitconnnnneeeect meme and the only object of value is 
CRYPTOCURRENCY. It is in this world where all sources of energy were exhausted by
miners that your adventure begins.

You were scavenging for scrap metal when you notice your trusty translator droid
C3PO started behaving erratically.

"Malware...", you thought.

Indeed, the protocol droid appears to have been attacked by malware. The usually
articulate translator is now repeating a single line of apparent gibberish. 

Intrigued, you quickly note down the line:

Upon closer examination, you realise it might not be random nonsense after all, 
in fact, you believe it contains the key to shed light on this strange episode.
