Konnichi wa!

Hiro, a UNSW exchange student from Japan, has forgotten how to decode his passphrase to his flag vault! Could you help him out?

== BEGIN CODED PASSPHRASE ==
FLAG{氷 動物 お金 ともだち 雨 おおさか おかね 雪 どうぶつ 氷 でんしゃ 動物 お金 どうぶつ}
== END CODED PASSPHRASE ==

Enter your decoded passphrase in this form: FLAG{<passphrase>}, all in uppercase. E.g. if the decoded passphrase was "hello", enter "FLAG{HELLO}"

Note: While actually knowing Japanese might be helpful, you can solve this with Google Translate and a keen mind ;).
